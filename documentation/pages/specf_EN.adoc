== Introduction

As part of improving the services offered to students and staff of our school, we propose the creation of an innovative website dedicated to the principle of afterwork, from finding a friendly place to work to discovering the beers available in the surrounding establishments to work in the best conditions.

This project aims to simplify the user experience by centralizing several key features in a user-friendly and intuitive interface.

The site will allow users to consult in real time the beers available in the various affiliated bars, to book tables in advance (next features ??), and to check the opening of these establishments. This platform will strengthen the visibility of the bars and encourage social interactions within our community.

With the rise of digital technologies and the growing demand for practical online solutions, this project is positioned as a modern and effective response to the needs of our school. It represents not only a practical advantage for users, but also an opportunity to strengthen the links between students, staff and local establishments, while promoting a friendly and collaborative culture.


=== Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a web platform dedicated to our school community, facilitating the implementation of Afterwork through simplified and centralized management of local bar information. This platform aims to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience by allowing students and staff to facilitate the preparation of afterwork between them.

== Functional Requirements

=== Choice of operating system

The program must work on machines with a Mac or Windows operating system.

== Non-functional Requirements

=== Usability

The program must have a user-friendly design, providing clear instructions for users.

An intuitive command-line interface (CLI) can be implemented to facilitate easy program execution.

=== Performance

The program must be optimized to handle a significant number of Terraform files efficiently.

Performance testing must be conducted to ensure the responsiveness of the program, even under high load conditions.

=== Compatibility

The program must be compatible with recent versions of Python and Terraform.

Required Python dependencies must be specified clearly, and appropriate dependency management must be implemented.


== Validation Test

=== Functional validation

Functional tests ensure that the various modules or components correctly implement the defined requirements.

=== Solution validation

Solution testing ensures that the defined requirements are met from a use case perspective. Each large use case is validated in isolation, and then all use cases are validated together. 

The interest of these tests is to validate the stability of a solution in relation to the different modules that compose it.

=== Performance and robustness validation

Performance tests verify the compliance of t
